    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: April 3, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to IMEI Checker Bot. By using our Telegram bot and website, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>2. IMEI Checks</h2>
    <p>
      Our service provides IMEI lookup data for a small fee. This information is retrieved from third-party databases. We do not guarantee 100% accuracy and are not responsible for outdated or incorrect data.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Payments</h2>
    <p>
      Payments are processed securely via Payeer. Once a payment is made, results are sent automatically via Telegram. Refunds are not provided unless there is a technical issue or service failure on our side.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>
      All IMEI checks are delivered instantly upon payment. Since this is a digital service, we do not offer refunds once the check is processed.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      We rely on third-party APIs for data accuracy. While we aim to provide accurate results, we are not liable for any incorrect, incomplete, or delayed data returned by the IMEI database provider.
    </p>

    <h2>6. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for ensuring the correctness of the IMEI number you submit. Submitting fake or invalid IMEIs may result in a ban from the service.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Prohibited Use</h2>
    <p>
      You may not use this service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose, including but not limited to fraud or data mining without consent.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Modifications</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the service after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.
    </p>
